# Mist Bot

Mist Bot was envisioned to support the functioning of Mist, a World of Warcraft gaming community.
Built utilizing PyCord, the aim is to provide rich commands and seamless automation. 

Chief among the features is the automated Droptimizer parsing and aggregating toolset.
These features allow community members to submit Droptimizer reports from Raidbots, search for valuable information in the aggregated data, and build reports detailing this data.
